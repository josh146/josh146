### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [computational quantum physicist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pEj09c4AAAAJ) and
[software developer](https://github.com/josh146), working to build accessible, open-source quantum
software at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai).

### At a glance ðŸ‘€

* I am a leading product development at Xanadu, with a focus on [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), a library for differentiable
  programming of quantum computers, and [Catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst), a PythonJIT compiler
  for hybrid quantum-classical programs.
  
* I sit on the advisory board of the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund), a non-profit working to create
  an accessible quantum technology ecosystem.
  
* I hold a PhD in quantum computation from the [University of Western
  Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/research/ems-research-clusters/quantum-information-simulation-and-algorithms).
  
* I sometimes moonlight as an illustrator.
